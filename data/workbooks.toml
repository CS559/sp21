# All workbooks in one file
# This allows for creating workbooks (by selecting from the array)
# But also more "global" things

# The data structure is an "array of tables" - called workbook
# There should be 12 (1 per workbook)
# But also remember... While the workbooks are 1-12, the array entries are 
# 0-11

# question... is it better to have things as arrays (for easy looping) 
# or tables (for access by name)
# for some things, I am picking tables - make the keys be ordered so they list nicely (we )

# each workbook should have...
#   number (this should be index+1 - but its the actual number)
#   name (text string - without "Workbook X")
#   due (date of the Monday that the assignment is due)
#   learninggoals (array of strings)
#   points (table of rubric items - for NON-BONUS points)
#       note: this is a table so it can be referred to easily by item
#           make sure that the keys are named so they come out in the
#           right order while alphabetized
#   bonus (table of bonus points)

# there is a ton of other information that might be useful, however
# it's not clear how much we can make use of information in these things
# things I might want to add:
#   readings (table of external readings)
