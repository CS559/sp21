# All workbooks in one file
# This allows for creating workbooks (by selecting from the array)
# But also more "global" things

# The data structure is an "array of tables" - called workbook
# There should be 12 (1 per workbook)
# But also remember... While the workbooks are 1-12, the array entries are 
# 0-11

# question... is it better to have things as arrays (for easy looping) 
# or tables (for access by name)
# I've gone back and forth - and decided to try arrays (since they are easier)
# I think most of the easy access can be achieved by filtering (e.g. show)
# everything for a box

# each workbook should have...
#   brief - a brief description (first thing on the page)
#   number (this should be index+1 - but its the actual number)
#   name (text string - without "Workbook X")
#   due (date of the Monday that the assignment is due)
#   learninggoals (array of strings)
#   points (array of rubric items - for NON-BONUS points)
#   bonus (array of rubric items - for bonus points)

# for rubric items we need...
#   number of points
#   page
#   box
#   desc (description)

# there is a ton of other information that might be useful, however
# it's not clear how much we can make use of information in these things
# things I might want to add:
#   readings (table of external readings)
